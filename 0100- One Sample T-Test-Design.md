# [0100] One Sample T-Test - Design
This checklist details the design plan for assessing the consistency and accuracy of One Sample T-test implementations across R, SAS, and Python. Each section specifies input parameters, statistical agreement criteria, expected results, and known tool-specific limitations.

# Input Dataset 
Select or synthesize input dataset 

# Agreement Criteria 
T statistic and p-value should have an absolute difference of <0.000001 across R, SAS, and Python for numeric agreement. 

# Expectations for Supported Statistic
R, SAS, and Python should output consistent values for: 
- Confidence Interval (abs diff < 0.0001)
- Degrees of Freedom (should be the same across all outputs)
- Mean (abs diff < 0.0001)
- Min & Max 
- Standard Deviation 
- Standard Error 
- Agreement w/null hypothesis (should be the same across all outputs)

# Function Usage and Critical Arguments 
Record function usage and critical arguments (e.g., svydesign())

# Known Incompatibilities 
Identify known incompatibilities (e.g., Python lacks quantile support)

# Comparison Protocol and Metrics 
Outline comparison protocol and metrics

# Design Notes and Dataset 
Upload design notes and dataset
