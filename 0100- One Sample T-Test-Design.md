# Input Dataset 
Select or synthesize input dataset 

# Agreement Criteria 
Define numeric agreement criteria (e.g., abs diff < 0.001 for means)

# Expectations for Supported Statistic
Document expectations for each supported statistic (mean, total, etc.)

# Function Usage and Critical Arguments 
Record function usage and critical arguments (e.g., svydesign())

# Known Incompatibilities 
Identify known incompatibilities (e.g., Python lacks quantile support)

# Comparison Protocol and Metrics 
Outline comparison protocol and metrics

# Design Notes and Dataset 
Upload design notes and dataset
